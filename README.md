# justcalendar.ai

A single-page infinite scrolling calendar built with Vite and vanilla JavaScript.
Entirely created via a Telegram bot connected to Codex, using Ductor: https://github.com/PleasePrompto/ductor

## Features

- Infinite month timeline with lazy-loading in both directions.
- Multiple calendar types: `Semaphore`, `Score`, `Check`, and `Notes`.
- Score calendar supports `Number`, `Heatmap`, and `Number + Heatmap` display modes.
- Notes calendar includes inline previews, delayed hover preview, and focused day editor.
- Calendar management UI with add, edit, and delete flows (with duplicate-name guard and delete confirmation).
- Pinning system with animated reorder, max 3 pins, and pinned chips shown in the header.
- Theme system with 5 themes (`Dark`, `Tokyo Night Storm`, `Solarized Dark`, `Solarized Light`, `Light`).
- Day interaction supports selection, optional pan/zoom + expansion behavior, and keyboard `Esc` close.
- Developer controls for zoom, expansion, and background fade tuning (`P` shortcut + mobile toggle).
- State persistence via `localStorage` for calendars, day values, theme, and tuning controls.
